This project was started by Paul Wilson [@statusfailed](https://github.com/statusfailed).

Edward Kmett stole it and decided he was going to polish it up and put it on hackage. In the process he took all sorts of liberties with the structure of
the project. If you don't like the result, it is probably his fault.
